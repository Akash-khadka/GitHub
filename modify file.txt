Modify Files:
-first modify the file in your local computer that has been added to github.
-then
	 git add "one.txt"//one.txt is the modified file name
-then
	 git commit -m "file updated"
-the file has been updated in github

Viewing Commit History(to return to previous file state or retrieve content of file from the past):
-git log => View commit history
	-using git log SHA value of commits is shown which is unique for each commit
	-eg: commit c61e42b68b9b97aa9531150e1fd3d90f610f3ea0

-git log --oneline => view commit history in one line
	-eg: c61e42b first file added
-These ids helps us to go to any commit we want or go to prevoius stage of file before updating.

for example:
	-After updating file one.txt it contains 
	My name is Akash Khadka.(commit 1)	
	I live in Budhanilkantha.(commit 2)
	-Now to return to commit 1 i.e to display only 
	My name is Akash Khadka is local computer file
	- git checkout SHA value of commit 1 (i.e c61e42b68b9b97aa9531150e1fd3d90f610f3ea0 or c61e42b)
-This only changes the content of the file in local computer not in github.
