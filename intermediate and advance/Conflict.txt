*Two person working on same file (Conflict may arise)
 
 [Sender point of view]
-If sender created new Country.txt, commits and upload to github.
-And after uploading to github writes "Country" inside that file
-The addition of "Nepal" in Country.txt is not commited and uploaded to github.
 
 [Receiver point of view]
-goto gitbash and: $ git pull origin master.
-all the files are pulled along with empty file Country.txt.
-Now receiver adds "India" to Country.txt.

-Here 2 persons have edited the same file

-Now the receiver add, commit and push Country.txt containing India
 $ git commit -am "Content added to new file" //am means add and message
 $ git push origin master
-Now the changes is pushed in github.

-Now the sender also add, commit and push Country.txt containing Nepal
 $ git commit -am "Content added to new file"
 $ git push origin master

-A conflict can be seen as the file is already pushed with some content on it, we can
 only edit those files by pulling files 
-$ git pull origin master (from sender point of view)
-$ you get the option in code editor either to save both changes or incomming changes or
 save current change
-Now as the file is changed you should add and commit again and push to github
   $ git commit -am "new file conflict solved"
   $ git push origin master
