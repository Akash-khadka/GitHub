-A Git fork is nothing more than a copy of an existing repository, along with a change to the name of the
folder in which that repository resides. 
-The change to the folder name creates a new Git URL, 
which makes the new repository immune from updates by developers who use the old URL to contribute to 
the code base. 
-That’s it. That’s all you need to do to fork a Git repository.
