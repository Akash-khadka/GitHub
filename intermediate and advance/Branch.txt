*************BRANCH*****************
- Now to work on a clonned file you must create a branch.
(Advantage of creating a branch: you can edit project as you like in your branch, if the
 feature or code works successfully you can merge your branch in main branch else delete the bracnh)
- To create a branch: $git branch branchname(say Address for editing Address.txt file)
- -Now to see the branches: $ git branch
	it displays
		*master //* means we are in master branch
		Address // This identifies Address branch
- Now go to Address branch: $ git checkout Address
- Now we are on Address branch and we can work on any file and the main branch or 
  main project wont be affected.
- Now edit the Address.txt file and save.
- Now goto Address branch and merge
- check status: $ git status
- add: $ git add .
- commit: $ git commit -m "Address.txt changed"
- Now if you goto master branch: $ git checkout master
- You wont see the changes made in Address branch because changes are not made in master branch
  so we should merge Address branch with master branch.
- Goto branch you want to merge Address branch to i.e goto master branch
- To merge:
	-goto Address branch: $ git checkout Address
	-$ git log --oneline and copy hash value of Address branch
	-goto master branch: $ git checkout master
	-$ git merge Address
-Now $ git log ---oneline Now you can see the copied hash value of Address branch in master branch

-NOTE: If you found that the code in Address.txt has some error ew can go back to previos commit
	- $ git log --oneline //gives all commits hash value
	- Copy the hash value of previous commit where you wnat to go then
	- $ git reset --hard paste hash value(all or only 4 alphabets)
	- we can see the changes previously made in Address.txt is gone

-Now to edit another file create another branch and follow all the methods mention above.
-To delete the branches
	merged branches: $ git -d branchname
	unmergerd branches: $ git -D branchname
-Now push in github: $ git push origin master

 [Again sender point of view]
-To see the work done by others 
-$ git pull origin master
-All the works are displayed.

**Important
-If after pushing edited Address.txt to github.com, if any error occur in that file
-Create a new branch and follow instructions above.
